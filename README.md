## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔹 1. Mean_Variance_Standard Deviation Calculator
A simple calculator to compute the mean, variance, and standard deviation of numerical data using NumPy.

### 🔹 2. Medical_Data_Visualizer
Visualizes patient data (e.g., cholesterol, BMI, etc.) to identify trends and health risks.

### 🔹 3. Page View Time Series Visualizer
Performs time series analysis and visualization of page views from a dataset. Includes line plots, bar plots, and box plots.

### 🔹 4. SeaLevel Predictor
Uses linear regression to analyze sea level data and predict future trends related to climate change.

### 🔹 5. Demographic Data Analyzer
Cleans and analyzes U.S. demographic and salary data to extract meaningful statistics and patterns.
